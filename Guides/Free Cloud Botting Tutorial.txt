Note: This guide is fairly technical. You'll set up a Google cloud project, create a free VM, and run IdleRSC through the VM. All parameters will be passed through command-line, and there will be no visual interface for your bot.


Create a Google Cloud account: https://console.cloud.google.com

Create a Google compute engine running Ubuntu for free
  +-----------+----------------+
  | Region    |       us-east1 |
  | Series    |             N1 |
  | Type      |       f1-micro |
  | Image     |   Ubuntu 20.04 |

Click the SSH button to enter your new OS

Download Java 8 headless and a fake Xorg
    sudo apt update ; sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre-headless xvfb

Disable gnome assistive technology for Java
    sudo sed -i -e '/^assistive_technologies=/s/^/#/' /etc/java-*-openjdk/accessibility.properties
    
Set up IdleRSC
    git clone https://gitlab.com/idlersc/idlersc.git
    cd idlersc
    mv ColeslawCache Cache
    
    Edit run_linux.sh to be 
    xvfb-run -a java -cp "IdleRSC.jar:patched_client.jar" bot.Main "username" "password" "scriptname" "scriptparams, leave this random one if script takes no param"
    

Debugging & Tips:

Finding what went wrong can be difficult. Here are my debugging tips:

1. View what's happening (SSH forward)
    * Get Gcloud command line app: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
    * Click the dropdown beside the SSH button on Google Cloud, copy the "gcloud version", and add --ssh-flag="-X" after the ssh, i.e. 
    $ gcloud beta compute ssh --ssh-flag="-X" --zone "us-east1-b" "Y" --project "test-bot-218721"

2. Test your launch script locally
    Surprisingly, passing the script name was throwing an exception for me on some Sbot scripts, and I had to pass an additional garbage argument. While possibly a bug in IdleRSC that won't exist in the future, always test locally!
    
3. Walk to where your bot is on another account
    This one's self explanatory

4. Getting "no icedtea-sound in java.library.path"
    Mute the sound in OpenRSC settings
